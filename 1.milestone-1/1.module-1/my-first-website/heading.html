  In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a <small>contractor</small> at CERN,
  <em>proposed</em> and <strong>prototyped </strong>ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
  researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
  proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.
</p>
<p>
  Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late
  1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
  collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally
  adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of
  the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first
  entry.
